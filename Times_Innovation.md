# Times Innovation Privacy Policy

Times Innovation places great importance on your privacy. All data generated during use will only be stored locally on the device, and no data will be uploaded (Times Innovation is a completely local standalone application with no remote servers). There are also no user behavior or application usage statistics generated or uploaded.

The third-party brands and logos mentioned in this document or online storage services are cited as text references and have nothing to do with the related brands and trademarks.

### What personal information we collect or access

- When you download and install Times Innovation, during use, Times Innovation will silently access your app's local purchase receipt file to verify the legality of this purchase with Apple's server, preventing software piracy. The entire process strictly uses system-provided interfaces to ensure maximum security and privacy of receipt verification.

- Times Innovation does not perform any online statistics or uploads of any data; you can view, delete them at any time anywhere, or export for processing. You have unique and complete control over all your data.

- When you save data to the photo album, the app will ask for permission to access the album.

We may update our privacy policy at any time. If there are significant changes to the privacy policy, we will notify you within the app about the updated privacy policy.
